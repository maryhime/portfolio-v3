            Being in the Computer Science field during my college days, it was kind of overwhelming to decide which field will I be taking after graduation. I had been contemplating that since my first year until right before graduation.

            Luckily, my college internship is about UI / UX Design, which, I had fun learning and doing. So now, for the past year, Iâ€™ve been working at Baguio City as a Web Designer, which I greatly enjoy.
